IMDB's metric:

m is the number of vote count in the xth percentile among all movies
c is the mean of all vote averages

first step is that take onlly the movies that has a vote count greater or equal than m
second sort these movies by a score that is calculated by this metric:

							score_of_a_movie =
		(vote_count_of_movie/(vote_count_of_movie + m)) * vote_average
									+
					(m/(m + vote_count_of_movie)) * c

then show the first n movie
